This is the manual to create an MP3 and Spotify Player controlled through RFID Tags and GPIO Buttons. 

This is based on the Pi Musicbox: https://github.com/pimusicbox/pimusicbox ,
the music-cards mopidy extension: https://github.com/fsahli/music-cards ,
and the mopidy-ttsgpio extension: https://github.com/9and3r/mopidy-ttsgpio

To create this Player you first have to install Pi Musicbox on your local Raspberry. 
You can download the Image frome here: https://github.com/pimusicbox/pimusicbox/releases/tag/v0.7.0rc5
