  <h1> toddleplayer </h1>
  <p> Toddleplayer is primarily a manual which I created to build a musicplayer for my niece and nephew. It is based on <a href= "https://github.com/pimusicbox/pimusicbox">Pi MusicBox</a> and <a href= "https://github.com/fsahli/music-cards">fsahlis music-cards</a>. I modified fshali  scripts to make it possible to play local files : <a href= "https://github.com/tschuehly/music-cards">tschuehly music-cards</a>. I also developed a script to control pimusicbox with GPIOs because the other modules I tried were way to slow. You can view it here : <a href="https://github.com/tschuehly/musicbox_gpio">musicbox_gpio</a></p>
